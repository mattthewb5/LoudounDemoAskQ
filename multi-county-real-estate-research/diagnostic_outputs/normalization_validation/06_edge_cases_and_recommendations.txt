EDGE CASES & RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

SCHOOLS REQUIRING SPECIAL HANDLING:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Found 1 collision group(s):

Collision: 'STERLING'
  - Sterling Elementary
  - Sterling Middle

SPECIAL CASE: Sterling Elementary vs Sterling Middle
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Both normalize to 'STERLING' - this is expected behavior.
These are different school LEVELS (Elementary vs Middle).
The school boundary data assigns schools by level, so:
  - If boundary assigns 'Sterling Elementary' → match 'Sterling Elementary'
  - If boundary assigns 'Sterling Middle' → match 'Sterling Middle'
  - The school TYPE should distinguish them in practice

RECOMMENDATION: This collision is ACCEPTABLE because:
  1. School assignments come with implicit level (elem/middle/high)
  2. Chart data is grouped by level anyway
  3. A property won't be assigned both Sterling Elementary AND Middle

RECOMMENDED LOOKUP TABLE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOT NEEDED - Enhanced normalizer handles all cases for Loudoun.

ALTERNATIVE NORMALIZATION STRATEGIES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If issues arise in production, consider:
1. Pre-computed lookup table mapping boundary names to VADOE names
2. Keep School_Type in matching (Elementary/Middle/High)
3. Fuzzy matching with high threshold as fallback

IMPLEMENTATION SAFETY:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Enhanced normalizer safe for all schools: YES
  - Only 1 collision exists (Sterling) and it's by design
  - Sterling schools are different levels, not duplicates

Manual lookup table needed: NO
  - All test address schools match correctly
  - Middle initial variations (Steuart W. Weller) now match

Risk level: LOW
  - No new collisions created
  - Fixes the duplicate chart line bug
  - Backward compatible (schools without initials unchanged)
