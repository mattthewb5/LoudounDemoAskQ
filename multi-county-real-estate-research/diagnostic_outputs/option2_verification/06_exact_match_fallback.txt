EXACT MATCH FALLBACK ANALYSIS
======================================================================

Test Results:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

School: Steuart Weller Elementary
  Exact match found: No
  Matched to: None
  Records returned: 0
  Works correctly: No

School: Belmont Ridge Middle
  Exact match found: Yes
  Matched to: Belmont Ridge Middle
  Records returned: 5
  Works correctly: Yes

School: Riverside High
  Exact match found: Yes
  Matched to: Riverside High
  Records returned: 5
  Works correctly: Yes


Edge Cases to Consider:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Name variations: normalize_school_name() handles these:
   - 'Steuart Weller Elementary' → 'STEUART WELLER'
   - 'Steuart W. Weller Elementary' → 'STEUART W WELLER'
   ⚠ These DON'T match! Need consistent input names.

2. Whitespace handling: .strip() handles leading/trailing

3. Case sensitivity: .upper() handles case differences


Recommendation:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Exact normalized match IS SAFE for the current data because:
- All test schools have unique normalized names in Loudoun data
- The normalizer keeps distinguishing words (RIDGE, STATION)
- Only removes school type suffixes

CAVEAT: Must ensure school names from assignment boundary data
match the format in VADOE performance data. Current test shows
they use the same naming convention.
