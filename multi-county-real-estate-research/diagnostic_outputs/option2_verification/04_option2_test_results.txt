OPTION 2 VIABILITY TEST
======================================================================

Function Exists: Yes
Function Location: core/loudoun_school_performance.py:217-252

*** OPTION 2 IS NOT VIABLE ***
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The existing match_school_in_performance_data() function has a bug.
It would trade duplicate lines for wrong data.

Test Results:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

School: Steuart Weller Elementary
  Current (buggy): 1 school, 5 records (correct - unique first word)
  Option 2: Returns 'Steuart W. Weller Elementary' (via partial match)
  Duplicates eliminated: N/A (no duplicates with current pattern)
  Data correct: Yes

School: Belmont Ridge Middle
  Current (buggy): 3 schools, 15 records (Belmont, Belmont Station, Belmont Ridge)
  Option 2: Returns 'Belmont Station Elementary' (WRONG!)
  Duplicates eliminated: Yes
  Data correct: NO - shows wrong school's data!

School: Riverside High
  Current (buggy): 2 schools, 10 records (Riverside High, Riverside Elementary)
  Option 2: Returns 'Riverside High' (correct - appears first in file)
  Duplicates eliminated: Yes
  Data correct: Yes (by coincidence - Riverside High before Riverside Elementary)

CONCLUSION: Option 2 is NOT a reliable fix.
It works for some schools by coincidence of data file order.
